# Data-Mining-Classifiers

` It is an assignment for [DS4013 Data Mining] in BNU-HKBU United International College Data-Science undergraduate programm. `

This repository contains implementations of k Nearest Neighbor Algorithm, Naive Bayes Classification and Perceptron Classification in plain Python (Python Version 3.6+). These three algorithms are implemented from scratch without using additional machine learning libraries. Besides, this repository contains 5 classifiers by scikit-learn.
